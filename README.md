You also need to be registered at [Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/) and setup the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to access the dataset using their xcube_sh API.

Before running this code, make sure you have xcube activated using conda.

## DESCRIPTION

This is a prototype for mapping possible vehicle locations using Sentinel 2 L2A dataset and storing their data in a NETCDF dataset. One can use QGIS to import the dataset and further analyse it as required. The images created has two different colors two distinguish between vehicles found during 2019 and 2020.
